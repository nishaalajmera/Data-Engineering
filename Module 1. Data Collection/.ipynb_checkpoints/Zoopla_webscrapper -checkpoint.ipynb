       "  \"Comments from the owner:What do you love most about your home?We love the large floor to ceiling windows throughout the whole apartment, keeping the flat light all day long. We also love the open plan kitchen/living area so one of us can do the cooking whilst the other can keep them company from the sofa! As well as the large wraparound balcony that gives us privacy and somewhere to relax with a drink after a long day.What do you love about the area?We just love that Kidbrooke Village actually feels like a village, despite being 15 minutes from Central London. Everyone is incredibly friendly - whether it's your neighbours who become friends or the guys we run into every Saturday in the park with their sausage dogs, you feel like part of a community.We love the local Pub, The Depot found inside the Village Square, where at the weekends we also have a wander to see the pop up food market and walk down into Blackheath. One of the great things about living here is that you can walk to everything you need! The gym we have access to, the local Sainsburys, the Pub, nice restaurants, lots of parks and free Tennis courts too!I've always felt incredibly safe in Kidbrooke Village too - with round the clock security; communal gardens for the kids to play in and secure entrances to the buildings and floors, it's never been a place i've felt uncomfortable and not necessarily what you'd expect so close to London!Property Details:Offering beautifully presented, bright and spacious accommodation with high quality interiors and excellent inbuilt storage space, this superb fourth floor apartment in a fantastic central location.Accommodation comprises entrance hall with inbuilt storage and wood effect flooring (evident through the majority of the property), leading into the bright and spacious, open plan dual aspect reception/kitchen, flooded with natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows and doorway leading out onto the wrap-around private balcony.The kitchen area comprises a modern range of matching white fronted wall and base units with work surfaces incorporating inset sink unit, induction hob with overhead extractor and electric oven below, and further space for appliances. There are three well sized bedrooms with ample space for free-standing furniture and modern en-suite to the master, plus a stylish family bathroom with white three piece suite and elegant tiling.The property is conveniently located within easy access of Kidbrooke station, as well as numerous regular bus routes all providing excellent links into Central London, the City and the surrounding area. There are a variety of shops and amenities nearby, with nearby Blackheath, just a short distance away, offering a fashionable array of boutique shops, cafes, bars and restaurants.
